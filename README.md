# Insilico-DrugDiscovery

## Introduction

Traditional drug discovery and development is cost and time intensive, with an average of 10-15 years of R&D, and an estimated cost of $58.8 billion USD30. To give a perspective, of 10 000 screened chemical compounds, only 250 will move to clinical testing[1]. Further, out of drugs that pass Phase I of clinical trials, only around 11.83% are approved for market[2]. The consequence is that drug discovery has ceased for some therapeutical areas such as antibiotics[3]. The high cost and failure rates of the traditional path have prompted the need for computational machine learning to aid drug discovery. In this project I will use a machine learning model for discovery and will start with extraction, collection, and cleaning of data from the chEMBL database!
